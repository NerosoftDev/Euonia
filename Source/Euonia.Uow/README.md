- **Repository Integration**: Works seamlessly with repository patterns to provide a clean and organized way to interact with the database.
- **Support for Multiple Databases**: Compatible with various database providers, allowing developers to use their preferred database technology.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API for starting, committing, and rolling back transactions.
- **Open Source**: Actively developed and maintained as an open-source project.
